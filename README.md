# FTP Client Electron Example

An electron example built with electron-webpack and Typescript support. [Icon by Dryicons](https://dryicons.com/free-icons/file-types-icons). No JS Framework used.

This repository is simply an electron example and should be treated as such.

Features:
- List files from an FTP directory
- Upload a file to an FTP directory by dropping it into the application window

I also created a quick introduction to electron presentation, which can be found [here](https://slides.com/bernatzaragozatravieso/electronintro)
